Zebu - Simple LISP-inspired AST Implementation
==============================================

This library provides utilities to build and walk Abstract Syntax Trees; it was
originally designed to work with the kind of parsers generated by Yacc or GNU
Bison, hence the name and the jokeyish zz namespace.

See [apidoc.rst](doc/apidoc.rst) for the API documentation.

See [install.rst](doc/install.rst) for installation instructions.

See the [examples](examples/) directory for usage examples.
